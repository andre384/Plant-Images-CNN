# Plant-Images-CNN
Convolutional Neural Networks are a common technique for analyzing images. CNNs use kernels and other layers to find patterns in the images. This notebook will 
demonstrate CNN models that will classify flowers. This can benefit gardeners and landscapers because it is important to identify plants 
like invasive species that may not be desirable for a specific natural area. The data set contains images of flowers in JPG format. Each image has 256 x 256 pixels. 
There are 16 different types of flowers with hundreds of images for each type. For this analysis, only 8 types are selected for classification.
